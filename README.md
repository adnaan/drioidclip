drioidclip
=========

Collection of android snippets and a dumb(as in Dumb as a Dodo) bash script to copy to clipboard or file. I use it to copy code around since Android Studio(or any other IDE) is just too huge for my AMD E-450 notebook. I use vim.

Installation
===========
> 1. Clone this repo

> 2. Install xclip

> 3. Add droidclip to $PATH


Usage
=====
`droidclip #shows available snippets`

`droidclip ll #copies LinearLayout to clipboard`

`droidclip ll mylayout.xml #appends LinearLayout to file`

Roadmap
======

Roadmap seems a heavy word for a tool as simple this, but I do want to add scaffolding features. Let's see.
